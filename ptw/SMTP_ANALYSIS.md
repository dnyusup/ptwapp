# SMTP Troubleshooting Results

## Problem Analysis
✅ **Server Connection**: smtp.hostinger.com:587 can be reached
✅ **Port Access**: Port 587 is accessible 
✅ **TLS Handshake**: STARTTLS negotiation works
❌ **Authentication**: Fails with "535 5.7.8 Error: authentication failed"
❌ **Connection Reset**: Server resets connection from localhost

## Likely Causes:

### 1. Hostinger SMTP Restrictions
- SMTP access might be restricted to **Hostinger hosting IPs only**
- Localhost/development environments may be blocked
- Some shared hosting providers block external SMTP access

### 2. Email Account Configuration
- Email account might not have **SMTP enabled**
- May require additional setup in Hostinger panel
- Possible 2FA or App Password requirement

### 3. Credentials Issue  
- Password might be different than displayed in panel
- Account might be suspended or have restrictions

## Solutions to Try:

### Option 1: Gmail SMTP (Recommended for Testing)
```env
MAIL_MAILER=smtp
MAIL_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
MAIL_PORT=587
MAIL_USERNAME=your-email@gmail.com
MAIL_PASSWORD=your-app-password
MAIL_ENCRYPTION=tls
MAIL_FROM_ADDRESS=your-email@gmail.com
MAIL_FROM_NAME="PTW Portal"
```

### Option 2: Mailtrap (Development Only)
```env
MAIL_MAILER=smtp
MAIL_HOST=sandbox.smtp.mailtrap.io
MAIL_PORT=2525
MAIL_USERNAME=your-mailtrap-username
MAIL_PASSWORD=your-mailtrap-password
MAIL_ENCRYPTION=null
MAIL_FROM_ADDRESS=test@example.com
MAIL_FROM_NAME="PTW Portal"
```

### Option 3: Deploy to Production
- Upload to Hostinger hosting
- Test email from production server
- SMTP might work from their server environment

## Next Steps:
1. Try Gmail SMTP for immediate testing
2. Contact Hostinger support about SMTP access
3. Deploy to production to test from hosting environment
